App: fakepolls
DB: migration
Object: Magic

The purpose of this was to use django for the first time to
make our lives easier creating a database using objects.
Using our assignment from the weekend, in which we used SQL
for the first time to build a database, we transitioned it into
django. In my case, it is a database of magic cards with numerous
attributes.
